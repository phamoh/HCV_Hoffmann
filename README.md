## HCV Dataset from Ralf Lichtinghagen, Frank Klawonn, and Georg Hoffmann
Data downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data

I wanted to create a mock report using R Markdown with real-life data from a published study on liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in
patients with Hepatitis C. The report is generated as a PDF and include plots about the demographics of the subject in this study. 

Some of the graphs include: (1) bar graph of the patients' age ranges, (2) a stacked bar graph of the count of the patients' age range and sex, (3) a stacked bar graph of the count of the patients' age range and disease type from blood sample, and (4) Jitter plot of Albumin measurement in patients with "Hepatitis", "Fibrosis", "Cirrhosis".
