An R script that uses the packages tidyverse and ggplot to visualize the demographics of the patients in this study.
Some of the graphs include: (1) bar graph of the patients' age ranges, (2) a stacked bar graph of the count of the patients' age range and sex, (3) a stacked bar graph of the count of the patients' age range and disease type from blood sample, and (4) Jitter plot of Albumin measurement in patients with "Hepatitis", "Fibrosis", "Cirrhosis". 

The last plot in particular is to see how lab results can be an indicator for how patients may evolve through different stages of a disease, for example, low albumin level in patients with hepatitis C can be a sign of cirrhosis.
